The following items are still pending:

- Some logic in compute nodes when host is not in network_hosts
- Similar logic for compute nodes when using Nova Network
- Consolidate firewall manifests inside the controller/compute/network, instead of generating them
- Redis HA logic (ceilometer_800.py)
- Change message for plugins, when "creating manifests"
- Additional cleanup: remove unused functions in Python code
